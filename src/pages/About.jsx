              Jazsam Coffee started as a small family venture built on a shared love for home-brewed coffee and
              long conversations around the kitchen table. What began as experimenting with different beans and
              roast profiles soon turned into serving friends, neighbors, and eventually the local community.
              With encouragement from loyal customers and a passion for creating a welcoming space, the family

              every cup served.
